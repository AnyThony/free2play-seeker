## Setup

### useMock

In `src/config.json` you can set useMock (default: true) to false to load directly from the FreeToGame API instead of using the hardcoded data.

### `npm install`

Installs the required packages.

Then, you can run either:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
